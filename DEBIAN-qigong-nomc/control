Description: system's and applications' metrics collection-daemon
 This package provides binaries without memcache lib dependency.
 "qigong" establish timed metrics in a single ultra-light nifty
 running daemon and export them to it's paired (and eventually
 remote) aggregating daemon : "qicollect".
 Apart from a single security keyfile, all configurations are set
 from the collecting point.
